# 🎓 AI Course Generator from Videos — SensAI'25 Hackathon

⏱️ **30 Hours. Zero Sleep. Just Code, Coffee & Curiosity.**

This project was built by **Team CODE CRAFTERS** during **SensAI'25**, a 30-hour hackathon hosted by HyperVerge and our college. Out of 66 teams, 36 were shortlisted — and we proudly tackled a challenging real-world problem for course creators.

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

**"AI Assistant for Course Creators — Automatically Generate Courses from Videos."**

We aimed to help educators turn long, unstructured video lectures into clear, modular online courses — with:

* 📜 Accurate transcripts
* 📚 Structured modules & lessons
* ✅ Auto-generated quizzes

---

## 🚀 **What We Built**

* **Upload:** Accepts .mp4 videos or YouTube URLs
* **Audio Transcription:** Uses OpenAI Whisper Medium for balanced speed and accuracy
* **NLP Preprocessing:** Cleans, splits, and summarizes raw transcript text into lessons
* **Course Structuring:** Automatically organizes content into Course → Modules → Lessons → Quizzes JSON
* **Visual Analysis:** Extracts slides, titles, and code snippets with Scene Segmentation + GPT-4 Turbo Vision

---

## ✨ **What Makes It Special**

* 🔍 **Multimodal:** Fuses audio + visual context for better course quality
* ⚡ **Fully Automated:** Minimal manual curation needed
* 🧠 **AI-First:** Uses state-of-the-art Whisper & GPT-4 Vision together
* 🏗️ **Hackathon Prototype:** Clean starting point for a real SaaS product for educators

---

## 📈 **Future Improvements**

* ✅ Better scene detection for highly dynamic videos
* ✅ Fine-tuning GPT prompts for more consistent lesson structure
* ✅ Export to SCORM, PDF, or LMS-compatible formats
* ✅ Frontend for user edits and manual corrections
